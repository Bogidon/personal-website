- name: coffee block
  description: As part of our Products and Markets class I worked together with four other Olin College students to create an open source model for community-oriented coffee stands. Our model is a collection of brewing techniques, furniture plans, playlists and more that make it easy for any group, from individuals to city governments, to put together a popup coffee stand in a public space, serving free coffee to enrich their communities.

- name: Teespring shopping app
  description: "Brought Teespring.com shopping to native iOS. We (mostly me for 50% then with another developer for the rest) built the app in Swift and developed a pretty nice integration and deployment pipeline among other cool things. Sadly I didn't make time to write about any of them then... The app doesn't work anymore (though it's still on the App Store)"

- name: Teespring seller dashboard app
  description: Teespring is a marketplace for buying and designing+selling shirts. This app gave sellers the ability to see their stats, get notified of sales, edit marketplace info, and send emails from their phones. We (team of three devs, one designer) first wrote the app in Swift and later rewrote it for iOS and Android with React Native. Since the demo contains some private information please ask me for a password to view it.
